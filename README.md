# java-dietmanager
Java, GUI based application used to track the users diet and workouts.

Some features are missing/need to be implemented as such this is still not a finished project.
The application allows the user to add foods, assign their attributes such as calories which can then be used to monitor how much fats,calories etc. 
they have consumed for that day.

The application also features a work out section which is missing some features but it allows the user to add workouts which reduces the daily calory amount.
